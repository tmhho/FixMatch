# Semi-supervised learning: Implementation and analysis of FixMatch

__Authors__: Minh-ha Ho and Alexandre Personnic 

# Introduction

This project is within the scope of our Master's degree (ModIA of INP-N7 and INSA Toulouse), under the supervision of __Axel Carlier__. 
We aim to learn the insights and mechanics of semi-supervised learning (SSL). In this project, we implement and analyze FixMatch, a SSL model proposed by K. Sohn et al. in 2020.
